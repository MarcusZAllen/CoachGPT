# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

## Overview

CoachGPT is a personal training and fitness analysis tool that connects to Apple Health data and provides insights through a private ChatGPT interface.

This project is currently intended for personal use and does not offer public accounts.

## Data We Collect

CoachGPT may collect and store the following types of data:

- Workout data (e.g. running, cycling, duration, distance)
- Health metrics associated with workouts (e.g. heart rate, active energy, elevation)
- Time-based workout samples (e.g. heart rate over time)

All data originates from Apple Health via an export process explicitly enabled by the user.

## How Data Is Collected

Data is collected through:
- Apple Health exports using the Health Auto Export app
- Secure ingestion into a private backend (Supabase)

No data is collected without explicit user action.

## How Data Is Used

Collected data is used solely to:
- Provide training summaries
- Answer fitness and performance-related questions
- Generate coaching insights within ChatGPT

Data is not used for advertising, tracking, or profiling.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in a private Supabase database hosted in the cloud.

Access to the database is restricted and protected using authenticated API keys and server-side access controls.

## Data Sharing

Data is not sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties, except for essential infrastructure providers required to operate the service (e.g. database hosting).

## Data Retention and Deletion

You may stop data collection at any time by disabling Apple Health exports.

Data can be deleted by removing records from the backend database.

## Security

Reasonable technical measures are used to protect data, including:
- Authenticated API access
- Restricted database permissions
- Server-side processing of requests

However, no system can guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated as the project evolves. Any changes will be reflected in this document.
